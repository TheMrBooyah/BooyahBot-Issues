## Posting an issue
Before you begin: Please note that this is a formal site. Please avoid using slang, cursing, and being unnecessarily immature.

1. Discovering your issue and attempting to reproduce it.

2. Creating a GitHub account (if you don't already have one).
Creating a GitHub account (www.GitHub.com) is very self-explanatory and is much like creating accounts on other websites, and it is free. You will need an email.

3. Searching for duplicates of your issue.
Great! Now you have a GitHub account and you are on the issue tracker page (https://github.com/TheMrBooyah/BooyahBot-Issues/issues). One of the **most important steps** of this process is searching the GitHub issue repository for already existing copies of your issue. To search for a duplicate of your issue, simply type in keywords of your issue into the search bar pointed out in the image below. **If you find an issue which reports the same bug that you plan to report, there is no need to post the issue yourself!** The team is already alert of the issue, and any duplicate issue you may post of this issue is going to simply clutter the issue tracker and generate unnecessary bug reports.
**Tip!** An example search is: `is:issue is:bot crashing`. Make sure to include `is:issue is:open` before your keywords.

4. Posting your issue, titling your issue, and describing your issue.
Your next step is to actually post your issue on the tracker with the "New issue" button.
You will be brought to an editor.
You can get rid of the text inside of the main text, assuming you have complied.
**Titling your issue correctly is also a crucial part of the process.**.
Lastly, probably the most important part of creating an issue file is describing it.
Here are some things you should include in your description:    
--> How you can reproduce bug (How you can make the bug happen/execute)    
--> Commands involved    
--> Everything else about the bug and more    
You should now have a title and a description. The next step is to post the issue. When you are completely done with your issue, press the "Submit new issue" button.

5. Be patient.
Once you have submitted your issue to the issue tracker, you need you have patience with your issue. Your issue may be very well thought out and typed, but it may be extremely difficult to solve the problem and it may take months of coding or editing to fix it. Do not expect a response to your issue immediately, but we will try our best to get to you and provide you, as long as you comply with this guide. **If you do not correctly construct your issue, your issue will be closed, locked, and ignored.**

Thanks, and we hope you use this guide to improve the quality of our GitHub issue tracker.
